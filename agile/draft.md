## Agile means, what is it?
### Agile means
For [Meriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/agile) Agile means:
> Marked by ready ability to move with quick easy grace
and in Atlasian they said Agile gave to team 
> have a natural mechanism for responding to change quickly

Attlasian mention agile as: The power of adapt for future changes.

### Agile true power
Agile brings a framework to help the development team to have consistant deliveries, and plan more each detail of the project.
Instead of plan and develop at only one moment, Agile separates the project into a cicle.

#### Cicle
The agile cicle is basicly formed this steps:
- Plan
- Design
- Develop
- Test
- Deploy
- Preview

To resume the company has a Goal for 2 months delivery a big project, instead of doing 1 Planning step and delivering all the aplication in one time.
In Agile we separates those steps to each cicle, so the team can start to delivery little tasks than can be previewed to team,and with more steps to plan the project becomes more adaptable for future changes.


## Concept to Join NFL with Scrum

NFL has a objective: "Bring the ball to the adversary end zone". When that happen we call a touchdown and this play gave to the team who reach the best reward in the game 6 points.

NFL has a play called running play, it's basicly a runner with the ball trying to move towards the endzone.

So the objective in all running play is: Bring the ball to the end zone.
But for that they have to PLAN the ROUTE for the runner achieve the objective, but after the PLAN they have to execute the blocks to clear the route for the runner and the runner needs to choose the better route and avoid the tackles with AGILITY to move from directions.

If everything goes well, they for sure achive their goal: Bring the ball to the end zone.



## Think flashes
- Agile doens't means quickly, but can help build quicker sprint in the future.
- Agile make the base of product adaptable, it's makes better to adjust
- Agile isn't made to delivery task faster than other approcaches
- The difference between others approach is Agile makes easier and quicker to change your plans when the team are developing the product
- Agile needs each step beeing respect to have a sucessfuls sprints, no steps over the process.
- If the team jumps one of the process is a high chance to sprint not be sucessful
- 3 cone drill explanation: "How quickly you can change direction while continue to accelarate".
