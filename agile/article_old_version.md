## Introduction

### First paragh

- I've heard a common phrase after the development team gave a due date that product team wasn't expect to take that long to finish a feature, the phrase is:
But your team is Agile, that doesn't mean this task should be finisher faster? -- Version 1

- When the development team gave a due date to the product team, I have heard this phrase: "But did you are using Agile, that doesn't mean you are fast? -- Version 2 (Original)

To be fair they aren't wrong, Agile method it's a approach to improvement the delivery of the features, and most of the contents which is talking about Agile mention a lot the word faster, for example Attlasian:
To be honest they aren't wrong, Agile method it's a approach to make delivery of the tasks faster than the other approaches, even Attlasian mention that in they website:

But Agile needs a process to be agile, then after you turn into Agile company your company becomes to be faster. And that's what I want to explain in this article, why is important to be Agile first before being Faster. -- Version 2

## Meaning of Agile
To start I want to clarify what the word agile means, by Cambrigde means:

We can change the body project and that's what Agile method wants to improve, the power of Agile is to make the development team quicker to adapt for future changes or problems.

How Agile does that? --- Continue.
