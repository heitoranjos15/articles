## Introduction
- People working with IT(me included) probably have heard this phrase after you gave a due date to the product team:
But your team is Agile, that doesn't mean this task should be finisher faster? 

To be honest they aren't wrong, Agile method it's a approach to increase the delivery  of the tasks, even Attlasian mention that in they website: 
> - Agile is an iterative approach to project management and software development that helps teams deliver value to their customers **faster** and with fewer headaches.

But Agile has a proccess, and that proccess needs to be respect by all people involved on the project to be agile then faster, if this proccess isn't respect the company turns to not be Agile and maybe not Faster either.
That's what I want to explain in this article, why is important to understand and respect the process to be Agile then you start to become Faster.

<!-- But take a proccess to have a Agile culture, and this proccess needs to be respect, after the culture is finish the company starts to be faster. And that's what I want to explain in this article, why is important to be Agile first before being Faster. -->

## Meaning of Agile
To start I want to clarify what the word agile means, by Cambrigde means:
> - able to move your body quickly and easily

So instead other methods which needs to plan all project and then development, Agile separating the project into short periods, makes the project quicker and easy to adapt when needs changes or failures while keeping running the project. 

<!-- The same definition the word has.  -->

Now, how Agile does that? 
Agile has a lot of options to do that, but for this article I'll use as a example Scrum.

Scrum has cycles with few steps that needs to be repected in order to be Agile and stay Fast on development delivery of the project.

## Procces of Agile
So Scrum has a cycle that repeats after the actual cycle is finished, and all cycles has this steps:
- Planning
- Sprint
- Retro

I'm not going deep into explain all the steps here, but in case you need to know more about the proccess here some sugestions:

The goal in this article is to explain why this steps needs to happen exactly was planned to be and need to be respect. 

SCRUM always starts with a planning meeting, the product team presents some tasks from the project to the development team. The goal is to understand the tasks, discuss about the implementation, possible problems that can block the task to be finish.
Then after the Planning is over and all tasks is choose, the sprint phase starts. Sprint phase is when the developer starts develop the tasks and running to the goal complete all tasks planned in the short pre determited time.

When the limit of days of the sprint is over, the team reunite again to talk about what is done, what isn done.

Then the cycle restarts again with the planning.

This cycle requires a great communication by the team members and couldnt have interference in the steps to order to work well.

Before the Planning the product owner needs to receive the right information from the stakeholder about the project, then he needs to separate into tasks and describe all details correctly.

After the planning starts the developers need to know about the tasks he will be encharged, and during the sprint they should be able to run free with the tasks without interruptions into the process. If the project needs a new feature or a change that needs to wait to the next cycle starts.

I'll explain the importance of this steps and why needs to be respect in order to became Agile while still Fast.


## Example using NFL
The name SCRUM origin is from a sport called Rugby, on Rugby the SCRUM is called after some infringement of the Laws, the team reunites and the play is restarted.

As Agile, NFL is a sport based on Rugby, the goal of both sports is to advance into enemy field and score a touchdown or a field goal. The main diferrence is instead of wait some infringement on NFL after all plays the teams reunite. 

All plays on NFL starts with the coaches planning the play and informs to the Quarterback what play the team has to run, then the Quarterback informs to all players on the field what is the play, formation and directions, then the players get set at their positions and the play starts.

One of the plays choosen by the coaches could be the running play, basicly the Quarteback gives the ball to the running-back and him has to wait the blocks to open a free open space to start sprint towards the goal.

In order to the play be successful the communication needs to clear and everyones understand the play, if not will be a easy task to defenders stop the play.

First I'll show a nonsucessful running play:
![](./failed_run_play.gif)

This example could be caused by a bad plan or lack of communication between the team, because the defender on the left was free to stop the runner even with 2 players close to him.
The result of this play is the runner was stop early resulting into a unsucessful sprint.

![](./sucessful_run_play.gif)

In this case the communication went well, everyones understood their jobs resulting into a great start of sprint for the runner. So after the runner wasn't stop by any defender at the beginning now is his duty to be Agile to change directions to avoid the defender, while keep sprinting towards the goal.

## Conclussion

The running-back are the fasters player on the NFL game, but at NFL isn't only being faster to achieve their objective.
Is the same inside the company, you can have the fastest development team but like a running-back running to a endzone, to finish a  project is not a straight line, you need to have a great plan and communication to avoid some stops at the beginning of the project then starts to be Agile for future change directions, while still running a sprint directly towards the end of the project.

So to answer the question.
> But your team is Agile, that doesn't mean this task should be finisher faster? 

Yes the team is Agile, but it means when the project needs when a problem happens they will solve while still running fast.
