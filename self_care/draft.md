# What I want to share?
I want to share to people the experience I had solving my problems changing to Portugal.
The values that I get trought this experience:
- Focus in the things that you can control and do the best with those.
- Be patient, respect the time of the things. Don't rush it or regret, just live the moment

## Pilars of the article

## First idea from article
- When I arrived at Portugal, I had a problem:
I was in Lisbon waiting to my plan to Porto and I discoverd my plan to Porto was canceled by the airplane company, and I only this information, the airplane company didn't had the solution yet.
I was in Lisbon waiting to my plan to arrive in Porto, then the airplane company communicates the plan was canceled and we have to wait to their resolution.
Then this exact scene happend on airport:
------- Bug's life scene------
This is a scene by Disney film Bug's life, the Ants was trying to go back to their anthill, but a problem happend a Leaf felt off on their ways. Everyone starts be desperate and didn't focus how to solve that problem, 
Same on the airport, people was in rage about the situation, forming a enourmous queue to complain about the situation for the operators.

I was upset too, I was expecting to everything going well. But that wasn't in my control anymore I had to change my perspective, so instead of focusing on the leaf in the path, I was focusing on how to go around the leaf.

<!-- I was pissed off too with the situation, I paid to go to Porto without problems. But that wasn't in my control anymore, so instead of focusing in the leaf of the path, I was focusing on how to solve that problem. -->

Like that's what the Ant advise to his fellows, just calm down and go around the leaf:
------ Bug's life scene 2----

<!-- Until other Ant talked to they spoke relaxed to just go around the leaf, and the path was clear. -->

<!-- screaming to operators about that situation, a enourmous queue to talk to the operators. -->
And I have found some solution, but I need to know if the airplane company will refund my ticket, but the airplane company didn't had any new informations about their plans and the queue to talk to the operators was still big.
<!-- And I had some solutions, but I had to confirm with the operators to cancel the plane and recharge me back, but it was a enourmous queue to talk to the operators, most of them was raging there. -->

Then I realized I had a great opportunity to know the Lisbon airport, so I start to walk around the airport, looking at the views, talking to my family and friends.

<!-- talked to my family and friends. I had lucky to take this wonderful photo: -->
<!-- So I had my moment of being mad, but switch my focus foind the solutint and then to enjoy my time there, Lisbon has a beatiful airport so I start to look the views talked to my friends and family. -->

After a few hours we get to know the resolution: The airplane company will provide a bus to Porto. That's not exactly what I wanted but at least I was going to Porto.

When I was in the bus I realized a new value, be a friend of your time.

So in the end I was going around the leaf with the same people was super mad with the operators taking a bus to Porto.
<!-- Then I realized a new value, be a friend with your time.  -->
What I mean is, the plane was canceled and had nothing to do with that, but people always tries to rush their time, they dont accept losing it even if it's only 2 hours, they prefer waste their energy trying to solve what was already decided in the past.
<!-- What I mean to that is, people always tries to rush their time, and if something happens they start to be mad even if they dont probaly will solve their problems. -->

But I was like a kind person that lives in my heart always says: I have all the time in the world, so for now I'm just chilling.
I enjoyed the beatiful airport from Lisbon, they had a lot of beatiful views there, that was my first time into Europe so I was hearing a lot people talking to various languages and became fascinated by that, had a good conversation with my family and friends.
And I had lucky to registrate this moment:
---- Photo Lisbon -----

That was a value lesson to me, I made everything posible that I could and enjoyed my moment there. And that lesson helped me to face my biggest one in Portugal:

<!-- Then I discovered that the airplane was not recharging me back, instead they will provid a bus to Porto. -->
<!-- But instead of they, I had a great experience in the airport, I mean I was mad by the situation they put us, but at least I enjoyed my time there. -->
<!-- I was mad with that situation, but that doenst mean I will ruin my moment, just adapt your time and wait. -->

This problem helped me to face the biggest problem I had.

- I had a different challenge than the others people from Kwan (my PM Eliana knows that and can prove it), I came here alone and with some problems that took a little longer to solve it. 

<!-- but instead of being mad with the situation and quit the challenge, I choose to do my best every day to solve it, be patient and trust the process. -->
<!-- Those uncertains put me in an uncerted position, and I had 2 options: -->
<!-- - Be mad with everyone and quits going back to my old live in Brazil. -->
<!-- - Or do my best every day, be patient and trust the process. -->
It was stressful to waiting, because it wasn't in my control anymore, I could be pissed off with all the situation and start to complain probaly resulting into more stress, but that would not solve either. Or maybe I could quit from the challenge and go back to Brasil and live my old life.
But I choose make the best I can to solve it, trust in the people around, wait, and make this moment a great experience, then I started to know better the city I choose to live: Aveiro, look for apartments, knowing the markets, places to visit, go to the beach. 

After a few weeks everything was solve it, without any stress and I could celebrate better this victory. Waiting for this moment resulted into living into an amazing city, know new friends, experience and this article!

<!-- I choose the 2 option, it tooked a long time to solve it. But that resulted living into an amazing city in Portugal (Aveiro), new friends and a lot of experience. -->
<!-- In the moment I was waiting it was stressful, but that will only be solve it in the future, so I started to focusing on what I can do, and enjoy the moment here in Portugal. -->

<!-- But instead of quitting I did the best I could, and waiting trusting in the proccess. That resulted into living into an amazing city in Portugal (Aveiro), new friends and a lot of experience. If I choose to not be patient and quit in 2 weeks I was going back to Brasil. It's seems a great trade right? But those 2 weeks was very stressful, but instead of trying to rush in the future or thinking to go back to the past, I live the moment here in Aveiro get to know the city and in 2 weeks everything was solve it. -->

<!-- If you are planning to move to another country, yes it's  -->
<!-- What I can share with those experiences is,  -->
Moving to a new life it's big challenge, and probaly will have a lot of problems but sometimes it's feels great to fall into that.
<!-- If you focus on doing the best you can, wait -->
The challenge it's big, but everyone can do it, if you focus on doing the best you can, and enjoy the present.
Don't try to focus in the future or the past, that it's something you can't control. Prepare yourself to this changes, make plans, look at the citys and apartments, be aware of the costs; And if something goes wrong, we are humans let just make mistakes, learn with that and live the moment.

- So if you are going to Portugal to live a new life, don't try to rush the future, focus on preparation, look for apartments, citys and etc. Plan everything, and when you arrive here and something goes wrong, we are humans let just make mistakes, don't be mad with the choices in the past, learn from them andadapt to that, sometimes it's feels good to fall.

A live ins't a life until you live it.
