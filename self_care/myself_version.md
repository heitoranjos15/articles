# It feels good to fall

## Do the best you can.
Going to Portugal was a big challenge; it was my first time traveling to a new country by myself.
I was going alone, leaving my family and friends and my great life in Brazil to live a new life in another country. And if I accept the challenge but struggle to adapt to the weather, or don't find a great apartment, or people will reject me.
Those fears made me question myself about whether it was the correct thing, whether I should quit that challenge, and how I'm going to handle this new life alone.
 
During this phase of questioning about the decision to go to Portugal, I was watching a post-game interview with multi-champion NFL head coach Bill Belichick, when a reporter asked him about how he helps players navigate outside criticism:
 
- Sometimes it doesn't work out. Sometimes it does, but, I mean, in the end, you control your preparation, you control your effort, you control your attitude, you control your toughness. Those things are all in your control. You do the best that you can with those.

The question was out of my context, but the answer was about how to face the struggles. That made me reflect on my fears and how to overcome them.
Maybe if I focus on controlling my emotions and do the best I can every day to plan how I'm going to handle this challenge, I'll be able to handle my fears and solve some of my concerns mentioned.
My mindset with that gave me the courage to face my fears and concerns, plus it helped me get through some annoying situations I had in Portugal.
 
The first situation I faced was arriving in Portugal for the first time.
 
## Going around the leaf
I was in Lisbon waiting for my flight to arrive in Porto, and then the airplane company communicated that the plan was canceled, and we had to wait for their resolution.
 
Then this exact scene happened at the airport:

 
This is a scene in Bug's Life, a Disney film. The Ants were trying to go back to their anthill, but a problem happened: a Leaf fell off on their way. Everyone starts to be desperate and doesn't focus on how to solve that problem.
In the airport, people were furious about the situation, forming an enormous queue to complain about it to the operators.
 
I was upset too; I was expecting everything to go well. But that wasn't in my control anymore; I had to change my perspective, so instead of focusing on the leaf in the path, I was focusing on how to go around the leaf. Like the ant, who calmly pointed out to the others the way to go around the leaf.

 
And I found a solution, but that required me to know if the airplane company would refund my ticket. But yet, the airplane company didn't announce any news about their plans, and the queue to talk to the operators was still long.
 
Then I realized I had a great opportunity to get to know the Lisbon airport, so I started to walk around the airport, looking at the views and talking to my family and friends.
 
After a few hours, we get to know the resolution: The airplane company will provide a bus to Porto. That's not exactly what I wanted, but at least I was going to Porto.
 
With that experience, I realized a new value: be a friend of your time.
 
What I mean is, the flight was canceled and had nothing to do with that, but people always try to rush their time; they don't accept losing it even if it's only for a few hours; they prefer to waste energy trying to solve what was already decided in the past.
 
Me, instead, was like a kind person that lives in my heart and always says, I have all the time in the world, so for now I'm just chilling.
I focused on enjoying my moment in the airport and had a great time there. They had a lot of beautiful views. That was my first time in Europe, so I was hearing a lot of people talking in various languages and became fascinated by that. I also had a good conversation with my family and friends.
 
At the end, I was going around the leaf with the same people who were furious with the operators for taking a bus to Porto, but at least I had a good experience there.
 
## The value of waiting
This value of being a friend of my time helped me with the biggest problem I had here in Portugal.
I had a different challenge than the other people from KWAN (my PM, Eliana, knows that and can prove it); I came here alone and with some difficulties that took a little longer to solve.
It was a hard situation to wait in, again, it wasn't in my control anymore. I could be furious with the situation and start to complain to the people involved, probably resulting in a lot of stress, but that would not solve either. Or maybe I could quit the challenge and go back to Brazil, living my old life.
Instead, I choose to do the best I can to solve it, trust in the people around me, and wait.
It was hard for me to be waiting to these issues be solved, so I changed my perspective again. I realized I had time to get to know better the city I decide to live in: Aveiro, knowing the markets, places to visit, going to the beach, and looking for apartments.
After a few weeks, everything was solved without any stress, and I could start living in an amazing city. I got to know new friends, collected a lot of experiences, and now this article!
Thatâ€™s seems like a great result, right?
In the past, I had faced some big challenges too, but I always avoided jumping into them because I was afraid of the things I couldn't control. But since I made this change of my mindset to focus on things I could handle, that gave me the courage to jump and fall into the big problems, and now I can say: it feels good to fall

## Sharing some thoughts from going through those experiences
Going through those experiences, I collected some thoughts about the experiences that I want to share:
- Be patient with the process, and focus on things you can control, like starting to look for cities, apartments, and planning your budget (this one is something I failed at :D).
- If something goes wrong, you are just a human lets you make mistakes, and learn from them.
- You make your mistakes, your mistakes never make you.
- Respect the timing of things, learn from the past instead of being stuck on regret, wait for the future instead of rushing it, and most importantly, live your present.
- Don't have fear of living new experiences; at the end, a life isn't a life until you live it.
