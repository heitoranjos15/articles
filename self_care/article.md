## Changing to a new country is a big challenge. See how I solve it by only focusing on doing my best.

## Learning on doing the best I can.
Going to Portugal was a big challenge; it was my first time traveling to a new country by myself.

I was going alone, leaving my family and friends and my great life in Brazil to live a new life in another country.

That created concerns for me too, if I could adapt to the weather, meet new people, and find a great apartment. It was my first time dealing with those concerns, and it made me think about how I could handle them.

Maybe working as a developer for years made me used to having control of everything. If you are a developer, you know we are trained to think about everything around the solution: how many days it will take to be completed, what part will be the most difficult, and how to avoid great bugs. It's easy to have the answers to that because everything is in our control.

I was asking the same questions with my move to Portugal, but that doesn't work the same because not everything is in my control, which made me uncomfortable, and I questioned myself if it was the right thing to do.
 
During this phase of questioning, I was watching a post-game interview with multi-champion NFL head coach Bill Belichick, when a reporter asked him about how he helps players navigate outside criticism:
 
- Sometimes it doesn't work out. Sometimes it does, but, I mean, in the end, you control your preparation, you control your effort, you control your attitude, you control your toughness. Those things are all in your control. You do the best that you can with those.

This answer changed my mindset. I was focusing too much on things I couldn't control, trying to make everything perfect, but that is something impossible to control, instead, I need to focus on things I can control and then overcome what cannot be controlled.
With this mindset, I forget about my concerns and instead gave me the courage, plus it helped me get through some annoying situations I had in Portugal.
 
The first situation I faced was arriving in Portugal for the first time.
 
## Going around the leaf
I was in Lisbon waiting for my flight to arrive in Porto, then the airplane company communicated that the flight was canceled, and we had to wait for their resolution.
 
Then this exact scene happened at the airport:

![](leaf_1.gif)
 
This is a scene in Bug's Life, a Disney film. The Ants were trying to go back to their anthill, but a problem happened: a Leaf fell off on their way. Everyone starts to be desperate and doesn't focus on how to solve that problem.
In the airport, people were furious about the situation, forming an enormous queue to complain about it to the operators.
 
I was upset too; I was expecting everything to go well. But that wasn't in my control anymore; I had to change my perspective, so instead of focusing on the leaf in the path, I was focusing on how to go around the leaf. Like the ant, who calmly pointed out to the others the way to go around the leaf.

And I found a solution, but that required me to know if the airplane company would refund my ticket. But yet, the airplane company didn't announce any news about their plans, and the queue to talk to the operators was still long.
 
Then I realized I had a great opportunity to get to know the Lisbon airport, so I started to walk around the airport, looking at the views and talking to my family and friends.
 
After a few hours, we get to know the resolution: The airplane company will provide a bus to Porto. That's not exactly what I wanted, but at least I was going to Porto.
 
With that experience, I realized a new value: Do not focus on controlling the future; instead, focus on controlling your present.
 
What I mean is, the flight was canceled and had nothing to do with that, but people always try to rush their time; they don't accept losing it even if it's only for a few hours; they prefer to waste energy trying to solve what was already decided in the past.
 
Instead, I was like my favorite musician, Mac Miller, says in one of his songs: I have all the time in the world, so for now I'm just chilling.
I focused on enjoying my moment in the airport and had a great time there. They had a lot of beautiful views. That was my first time in Europe, so I was hearing a lot of people talking in various languages and became fascinated by that. I also had a good conversation with my family and friends.
 
At the end, I was going around the leaf with the same people who were furious with the operators for taking a bus to Porto, but at least I had a good experience there
 
## The value of waiting
This new value helped me with the biggest problem I had here in Portugal.

I had a different challenge than the other people from KWAN (my PM, Eliana, knows that and can prove it); I came to Portugal without a project (I was in the process of starting one), and because of that, my contract and bank account took more time to solve.

It was a hard situation because I had to wait for those things to be solved, and again, it wasn't in my control anymore. I could be furious with the situation and start to complain to the people involved, probably resulting in a lot of stress, but that would not solve either. Or maybe I could quit the challenge and go back to Brazil, living my old life.

Instead, I choose to do the best I can to solve it, trust in the people around me, and wait.

It was difficult to wait for these issues to be solved, so I changed my perspective again. I realized I had time to enjoy and get to know better the city I decided to live in: Aveiro, knowing the markets, places to visit, going to the beach, and looking for apartments.

After a few weeks, everything was solved, resulting in an amazing project and the start of living in an amazing city. I got to know new friends, collected a lot of experiences, and now this article!

That seems like a great result, right?

Those situations made me think about myself in the past, I had faced some big challenges too, but I always avoided jumping into them because I was afraid of the things I couldn't control. But since I made this change in my mindset to focus on things I could handle, that gave me the courage to jump and fall into the big problems, and now I can say: It feels good to fall.

## Sharing some thoughts from going through those experiences

If you are starting or going through the process of taking the work visa, That's a great test to start, focus on doing the best you can to organize the documents and deliver them to the Embassy company. Probably you start to wonder about the time to receive your passport back or if it is rejected. But that wasn't in your control, and if you did the best you could, probably everything would go well, Instead of focusing on that, try to prepare yourself for this new challenge. These tips can help you start to plan:

- Try to look for videos telling about cities in the country you are changing, and choose your favorites.
- Then start to look in those cities. Some apps that can help you find: Idealista, Imovirtual, UniPlaces.
- Preview your costs when arriving in the new country, and how much you can afford to expend.
- Facebook has some communities made by foreigners living in the country to meet each other and enjoy some time together, that's a great way to get to know people.
- The most important: Once you arrive in the new country, enjoy your time there!

Even if you plan everything perfectly, something can go wrong, but like Belichick said in his interview, which I mentioned in the beginning: Sometimes it doesn't work out, sometimes it does; 
We cannot preview everything, but we can adapt to that and learn.

The last thing I want to share in this article, is some phrases that helped me through the hard times, and I hope they can help you too:

- If something goes wrong, you are just a human let you make mistakes.
- You make your mistakes, your mistakes never make you.
- Respect the timing of things, learn from the past instead of being stuck on regret, wait for the future instead of rushing it, and most importantly, live your present.
- Don't have fear of living new experiences; in the end, a life isn't a life until you live it.
