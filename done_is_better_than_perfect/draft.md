# Done is better than perfect

## Introduction

Have you ever started planned something, but never advanced? 
I have it, and most of the cases I was thinking to much into the project.
Thinking about every detail, trying to create the perfect solution for that, how my idea would change the world.
Then when you start to do the project you realise you are far from what you project, or sometimes wants to go back to the start because is not perfect yet. This process start to frustate yourself resulting into quit from the idea.
Well that's because you are thinking about perfection and not making things done.

## Run a marathon
> Better time to plant a three was 25 years ago,
But the second and the better time time to plant a tree of self-disciple is today - Eliud Kipchoge

Let's take a example of running a marathon, the top average speed is 20.01 km per hour by Samuel Kamau Wanjiru. But he started the marathon at 0 km per hour, no one starts at full speed a marathon. Each step is important to gain momentum, with momentum you reach higher speed make your average increase.
That's what Eliud Kipchoge did, he started to train and do marathon with a goal to be the first man to do a marathon under 2:00. With a lot marathons finished and unsucessful he started to improve to the point he made it in an marathon in Vienna.

It's the same for our goals, we just need momentum and the best way to get momentum it's to get things done.

In the past was common to be well prepared, but now everything changes so quick that if take too much time planning and doing nothing you will be left over by the market.

## The past wanted to be perfect
When it had no internet things were harder to get fixed. For example a news paper if had an mistake it only would be fixed in the other edition in the next day. 
So the need of being perfect was urgent, if something goes wrong it would take a long time to fix and you could loose money.
Today in an instant the author can fixed a news in his website, so the need of being 100% accurate is not the same as before.

## Perfection is just an ilusion, consitency is real
Nowadays we can just sell perfection as ilusion, becaus even the most sucessfull technlogies have some problems to fix it, nothing is totally perfect.
Gmail was in beta version for 5 years and people were using, and even now it's notin beta still receives some updates accordingly to the feedback from users. You can check the updates they do for the app as example:

Google realized now we dont need to wait for days to get a fix so chasing perfection is not need anymore, you can get things done and fix along the way. 

## Fear of failure
But there is a controversy in this feeling, because how we can reach perfection without knowing the failure?
Perfect means nothing is wrong, but how we will know that without the feedback from the others? Because it can be perfect for you, but not perfect to the others. Ending up nothing is perfect.

## Fear of mistake
> Well, it ain't perfect but I don't mind
 Because it's worth it - Mac Miller Perfecto

The reason to chase perfection I believe comes from the past we link with the fear of failure, but now that we can fix so quick why have fears of doing mistakes? 

Another sucessfull example is SpaceX, they started the project learning from past, and had a lot failure rocket launches, before their first sucessfull orbit. They werent afraid of having mistakes, because they knew mistakes are the best way to reach the perfect orbit.
That's what makes us advance so quick, it's because we discovered planning take more time than doing and fixing to be perfect.

## Sword 
Sword has the same mentality, all projects Thrive, Bloom, Move and Mind started as small products and got improved a long of the time accordinecessity of the users, that resulted into amazing feedbacks from the users and new ideas that wasn't there before.
The difference is Sword did a lot of things but still only 5% done.
