# Stop Overthinking, Start Doing: The Secret to Real Progress

## Introduction
Have you ever started planning something but never made progress?
I have, and in most cases, I was overthinking the project.
I thought about every detail, trying to create the perfect solution, imagining how my idea would change the world.
Then, when I finally started, I realized I was far from what I had envisioned—or worse, I wanted to start over because it wasn’t perfect yet.
This process led to frustration, and eventually, I gave up on the idea.

That’s because I was chasing perfection instead of focusing on getting things done.

## Run a marathon
> Better time to plant a three was 25 years ago,
But the second and the better time time to plant a tree of self-disciple is today - Eliud Kipchoge

Let’s take the example of running a marathon.

The fastest average marathon speed recorded is 20.01 km per hour by Samuel Kamau Wanjiru. But he didn’t start the race at full speed—no one does. Every marathon begins at 0 km/h, and each step builds momentum until the runner reaches their peak pace.

That’s exactly how Eliud Kipchoge approached his journey. His goal was to become the first man to run a sub-2-hour marathon, but he didn’t achieve it overnight. Through years of training, competing, and learning from unsuccessful attempts, he gradually improved. Eventually, he made history by breaking the 2-hour barrier in Vienna.

The same applies to our goals. We don’t need to be perfect from the start—we just need momentum. And the best way to build momentum? By taking action.

In the past, extensive planning was necessary before executing an idea. But today, things evolve so quickly that if you spend too much time planning without doing, the market will move on without you.

## The Past Prioritized Perfection

Before the internet, fixing mistakes was a slow and costly process. Take newspapers, for example—if an article contained an error, the correction could only be published in the next day’s edition. This made perfection a necessity, as mistakes were difficult to fix and could result in financial losses.

Today, things are different. A journalist can instantly update an article on a website, correcting errors in real time. The urgency for absolute perfection has faded—what matters now is progress, adaptability, and continuous improvement.

## Perfection Is an Illusion, Consistency Is Real

Nowadays we can just sell perfection as ilusion, because even the most successful technologies have flaws that require ongoing fixes, nothing is totally perfect.

Take Gmail as an example. It remained in beta for five years, yet millions of people used it daily. Even today, long after leaving beta, it continues to receive regular updates based on user feedback.
You can check in their realease updates:

Google understood that waiting for a “perfect” product is unnecessary. Instead of chasing perfection, they focused on continuous improvement—getting things done and refining them along the way.

## Fear of mistake
> Well, it ain't perfect but I don't mind
 Because it's worth it - Mac Miller Perfecto

The obsession with perfection often stems from a deep-rooted fear of failure. In the past, mistakes were costly and difficult to fix. But today, we can adapt and correct mistakes faster than ever—so why fear them?

Take SpaceX as an example. Their journey to success was built on trial and error. They experienced multiple rocket failures before achieving their first successful orbit. Instead of fearing mistakes, they embraced them as essential learning opportunities.

This mindset is what drives rapid progress. Overplanning delays action, while doing and adjusting along the way leads to real growth.

## Sword is only 5% done
Working at Sword, I’ve learned that getting things done is the best approach.

As a healthcare company, Sword’s mission is to free people from pain through technology. Every product—Thrive, Bloom, Move, and Mind—started small and continuously evolved based on real user needs. This iterative approach led to amazing feedback and new ideas that weren’t even imagined at the beginning.

At Sword, we say we’re only 5% done—because reaching 100% would mean striving for perfection, and perfection limits progress. The goal isn’t to be perfect; it’s to keep moving forward and making a real impact to the actual pain and the new ones.

Getting things done is always better than chasing perfection.
