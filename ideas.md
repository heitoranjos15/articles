    Like if you go to a gym and trained the first day youll feel pain and not to much changes in your body, if you go for the 2 day youll feel the same pain and your body will be the same. If you go to the 10000 day you'll feel a different pain, and your body more athletic.
The pain will always exists because it means we are changing, even when you not practice you'll feel pain in your body, however you will not going to see your body getting better.
It's the same for going out to the comfort zone.

The first days you will feel a lot bad feelings, feeling alone and your days will not change too much, but if you want to change your days, you have to keep practice everyday and improve.
