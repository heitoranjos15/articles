### value of evolution
- when a mistake happens, normally isn't the obvious solution will solute.
        When I made the mistake of my rent and my financials.
        The solution is not only economize, maybe was the choices I did without seeing if will make me better.
        That apartment was small, without a great place to work and with a high value, and because of the value it wasn't possible to expend money to have some great time, in other country, have new expierence and know other people.
        So even the value was great, i wont had a great time, so i a mistake I didn't made the best choice to myself

- I learn:
    - be present: enjoy your moment, don't think what could be if something was different, just accept how it is
    - be present: be present in the moment, be you in that moment and accept you
Knowing be present, i have knowlege of the moment my moment, i can see what choice i do to have a great moment now and in the future. 
Not for only a quick second
So if know the moment, i can choose the right enjoy my time, if I it's really worthy.

With that i can choose the best thing to myself, and know if the value is great or not.
Being be present evolved me.

When Tom Brady had the Interception and the score, he still in the process focusing in get better until the game is over.
He was focus on what his adversary did, how we can't adapt himself to do the best pass choice, what plays he should do, how motivate his team toward this situation.

As another victorious Michael Jordan said:
“I’ve missed more than 9,000 shots in my career, I’ve lost almost 300 games. Twenty-six times I’ve been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed. I’ve failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed.”

Having the mentality, when the mistakes happens, we don't focus 

Bernandinho wrote in his book Transformando suor em ouro (Portuguese book) an phrase: 
- "Giants are not those who don't fall, but those who stand up".
It's never about doing less mistakes, it's about how you evolve yourself to get trough that.

He never the situation overcome his focus and growing up, that made him the victorious.
