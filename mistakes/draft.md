## What do i really want?
I want to write an article to say about fail, how to handle that.
And why sucess became from failure (Tom Brady example), why is necessary (Jo Boaler experience)
How the sucess depends on the atitude when a mistake is made. (or when a mistake happens)

## Main idea
I made a big mistake, and now I'm living this failure phase. 
It was hard to admit in the past my failures, now I see as something that I can learn, that made me growth up as a person.
This actual phase I'm living, is the consequences of that failure, but isn't the end.
What makes this phase be a sucessful(and chase my dreams), isn't my mistakes is my next steps, is what i do next. (and only depends on myself)
Just keep swimming into this circles.

That's why Brady Interception is a great example, he made a big mistake and everything was against him at that game. 
But He kept working towards to win instead of quitting, arguably or trying to blame the defense.
This mentality made him the biggest winner of the NFL.


## Thinking
- Failure is a bad thing? Only depends on your attitude, you have the power to make that as a great learning tool towards your objective.

- You make your mistakes, your mistakes never make you - Mac miller
- Mistakes is not the end, what decides the ends its yourself.

- Mistakes is needed to grow as professional
- What make sucessful people isn't avoid making mistakes, is what they do after a mistake is made.
- Mistakes are great to learn, is not the end. What makes you growth is what you do after.

- Tom Brady made a mistake in his SB, but he never accept to loss. 
    When the game was over he was remembered as the most winner in the history of the NFL and
    the greatest comeback of the history, no one remembers his mistake.

- Tom Brady failed in that play, but his mentality keep him going through that fail and be the most sucessful player in the NFL

- Maybe use the house going down in the conclusion -- instagram reel 


### value of evolution
- when a mistake happens, normally isn't the obvious solution will solute.
        When I made the mistake of my rent and my financials.
        The solution is not only economize, maybe was the choices I did without seeing if will make me better.
        That apartment was small, without a great place to work and with a high value, and because of the value it wasn't possible to expend money to have some great time, in other country, have new expierence and know other people.
        So even the value was great, i wont had a great time, so i a mistake I didn't made the best choice to myself

- I learn:
    - be present: enjoy your moment, don't think what could be if something was different, just accept how it is
    - be present: be present in the moment, be you in that moment and accept you
Knowing be present, i have knowlege of the moment my moment, i can see what choice i do to have a great moment now and in the future. 
Not for only a quick second
So if know the moment, i can choose the right enjoy my time, if I it's really worthy.

With that i can choose the best thing to myself, and know if the value is great or not.
Being be present evolved me.

When Tom Brady had the Interception and the score, he still in the process focusing in get better until the game is over.
He was focus on what his adversary did, how we can't adapt himself to do the best pass choice, what plays he should do, how motivate his team toward this situation.

As another victorious Michael Jordan said:
“I’ve missed more than 9,000 shots in my career, I’ve lost almost 300 games. Twenty-six times I’ve been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed. I’ve failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed.”

Having the mentality, when the mistakes happens, we don't focus 

Bernandinho wrote in his book Transformando suor em ouro (Portuguese book) an phrase: 
- "Giants are not those who don't fall, but those who stand up".
It's never about doing less mistakes, it's about how you evolve yourself to get trough that.

He never the situation overcome his focus and growing up, that made him the victorious.

Coaches get fired, it doesn't matter what you do when you get fired, it matters how you react after getting fired.

9:20 -- this is a lesson...

11:25 -- nobodys will cares you got fired, nobody cares. what matters from this point foward is how do you do an autopsy on what happend, how do you understand what went down and make notes and you learn.

Beyond those behavior patterns, individuals identified as having a growth mindset also experience additional brain growth! In Mathematical Mindsets, Jo Boaler describes a study that shows when students with a growth mindset make a mistake on a math test, that mistake triggers “significant brain growth” that’s not present when they get the correct answer. 

Let me repeat: Those who got the wrong answer showed significant brain growth.

Michael Jordan, arguably the world’s best basketball player, has a growth mindset. Most successful people do. In high school he was cut from the basketball team but that obviously didn’t discourage him: “I’ve missed more than 9,000 shots in my career, I’ve lost almost 300 games. Twenty-six times I’ve been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed. I’ve failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed.”

These widely held beliefs are misguided. First, failure is not always bad. In organizational life it is sometimes bad, sometimes inevitable, and sometimes even good. Second, learning from organizational failures is anything but straightforward. The attitudes and activities required to effectively detect and analyze failures are in short supply in most companies, and the need for context-specific learning strategies is underappreciated.
