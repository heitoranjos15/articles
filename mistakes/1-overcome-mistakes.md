How do you feel when you remember the most mistake you had? If it still hurts I invite you to read this article.

Errar eh humano, viver no erro eh burrice

## Introduction
Who never didn't a mistake?
I did, working as developer and outside of my career too I think it's a common thing because I look for some sucessful people in Sports and they have they made some mistakes either, for example Michael Jordan said this about his mistakes:
- “I’ve missed more than 9,000 shots in my career, I’ve lost almost 300 games. Twenty-six times I’ve been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed. I’ve failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed.”

He said his losts and misses helped him to be successful, but if you think about other players had the same misses and lost as him, so what make him different from the others?

I watched and heard a lot of histories of other sucessful American player called Tom Brady, he is the biggest winner in all history of the NFL.
In one of his biggest game I learned what made Tom Brady different from the other players and why he was the successful one.

<!-- Even with all this miss shots all his losts, Jordan has the image of the most sucessful NBA player. -->
<!-- However a lot of other players have the misses or even more than Jordan, so why they are not sucessful as him? -->

<!-- I found the answer watching another sucessful person making a big mistake on the biggest stage possible, Thomas Edward Brady most know as Tom Brady. -->

### Game introduction
The game was the Super Bowl LI which New England Patriots played against Atlanta Falcons.
The Patriots had their most sucessful duo, Bill Belichick as Head Coach and Tom Brady as Quarterback. Together at that they had own 4 titles at that time.
Falcons was an surprising team at that year, with Dan Quinn as Head Coach and the best player in the league of the year Matt Ryan as Quarterback, leading the best attack in the NFL.

### Scenario of adversity
The start of the game was perfect for Atlanta Falcons team, everything worked as they planned against the Patriots. 
The attack unit was able to score 2 times, and the defense unit didn't allow Tom Brady to score creating an big defficit right at the start of the game.
Maybe because of that situation Brady was forced to take more risks with his plays, that made him to have an mistake:

This was a wrong pass made by Brady, he forced a pass to a player covered by 2 defenders, one of them antecipate and intercept his pass.
After that Brady still tryied to stop the Atlanta player from score:

But he failed and Atlanta player scored, increasing the lead by 3 scores.

At the 3 quarter of the game the score was 28 x 3. This was the biggest deficit in Super Bowl history, and probably the biggest adversity Brady faced in his carrer.

I remember being in a sports bar in Brazil watching this game and a lot of people was calling Brady a fraud, such a bad player. So if me in Brazil was hearing some people talking bad about this play, in the stadium it was probably worst.

However Brady always said he really doesn't care about other people opinion, he always is focus to give his best for the next opportunity, and if you see the movie from NFL after the play Brady was encouraging his teammates to continue fight, for him it was just a bad play but the game still happening and they have a chance. Even they had to make something no one did before.

<!-- However I think Brady never cared about the opinion from the others, he always was focused in giving his best for each opportunity he had. -->
<!-- He just look at the mistake and big adversity as a challenge and continue to be focus in how to deliver he best for the next play, even it was seeing as impossible. -->


<!-- However Brady didn't lost his focus, continue to fight and focusing his team to overcome that situation. -->

<!-- At that time Brady could choose to avoid make more mistakes, being less agressive, he already won 4 titles his carrer was sucessful at that point. -->

<!-- But this mentatily never made part of him in his carrer, he never cared about his mistakes, he always was focus on winning the game no matter what happened. -->
<!-- Even if the victory was impossible at that point, he was always focus on how to get better, how to help the team  to lead them to the biggest comeback of the history of the NFL. -->

---- GIF OF LAST PLAY -----
(Spoiler) At the end He overcome that adversity, at the end of the game the Patriots made the greatest comeback in the history of the NFL. 

I remember watching the broadcasting telling Brady surparssed his former child Idol Joe Montana and turned to be the biggest Quarterback winner in the history of the NFL with 5 titles, and the people was talking bad things about him was speechless, he proved again those people were wrong and really didn't deserve his attention.

Myself after the game was trying to figure out what happened, because everything was going off from Brady at that game. How he managed to mantain focus and continue to fight.
Well that's what differentiate him from the others, Brady never got stuck with things in the past even the victories, he always want to get better in the next opportunity no matter how the past was. So normally when a mistake happens usually we tend to think about the impact of that mistake, what other people are thinking about us, what will be my future, how can I change a thing already happens.

But if I think if we do like Brady does, take out those stressful things and focus what we can do improve for the next opportunity is the key to sucess.

### The difference
Back in the past when I did a mistake, I always was worried about what other people will think about myself, how that mistake will damage my carreer forever because of that. 

However in one of my biggest mistakes in my carreer was when the company I worked wanted a big solution being delivered at quick time, it wasn't well planned.

That new feature had a big mistake by me, because the time was short I didn't test enough and didn't look at the consequences my feature could cause in other features already implemented. That created a stressful situation for the company.
I remember living that moment with a lot of pain, because the situation was caused by me, but I figure out how to fix that mistake, but I always felt incompetent because of that mistake.

After a year, I had a talk with my leader back in that time and bring to the conversation the mistake I did, and he answered:
- What was problem? We got so many more problems after you move on, I couldn't remember that one.

But he remembered me about the good things I did, some useful features that agilize the work to they all the good things I did. It was the same feedback Brady had after the end of his game.

With that scenarios I discovered: 
- In the long time nobody will care about your mistakes. 

At the end of the day everyone makes mistakes, that's why they don't care about, what really matters after all is how you act after the mistake was made, in my case was how I solved the problem, and in the end that's what my leader really cared.

So why we need to care about what the mistake defines us?
That's what make Jordan and Brady sucessful and others not, they don't care about that, they are just focused in himself what he can do better and improve.

It's was the same with Brady victory in the Super

That new feature affect other functionalitty in monthly subscription flow, it started to accumulate payment retries in his credit card. It ended up creating such a stressful situation for the company 

### The real value
Most of us think everyone will be thinking about our mistakes, but let me bring a truth: Nobody cares about your mistake.

Like I said about Tom Brady after the game was over, I had the same feedback about my mistake, after a long time since I move on from the past company I had a talk with my leader at that time, I bring to the conversation the mistake mentioned earlier in this article and that's was his answer:
- What was problem? We got so many more problems after you move on, I couldn't remember that one.

But he remembered me about the good things I did, some useful features that agilize the work to they, and that was a great victory for me, it wasn't bigger than Brady victory, but a victory is a victory


At the end of the day everyone makes mistakes, that's why they don't care about, what really matters after all is how you act after the mistake was made, in my case was how I solved the problem, and in the end that's what my leader really cared.

So I suggest after an adversity first read this article: 
Then starts focusing in how get out of the adversity, you probably gonna start to see the value of this attitude and how much you can growth with this experience.



### Conclusion

The mistakes is different, Tom Brady was trying the best to help his team to achieve their goal but made a mistake, I was trying to deliver a great feature to the company but made a mistake too.
