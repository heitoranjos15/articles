The secret value of an mistake


How not letting the consequences of the mistake lead you to success.

Introduction 
When a mistake is made by us, the most difficult thing is to act before that. Sometimes we have to recover quickly, or sometimes the mistake cannot be solved and we have to live with that one. This affects us into disappointment with our mistakes, making the situation hard to live with. In other words, making mistakes hurts.

In sports the game is won by who makes fewer mistakes. It's kinda cruel to think about it, but we have fun while practicing and watching. For example, I like to watch sports competitions because we are able to see the most successful people fighting against the feeling of making mistakes. During competition you will have to learn loss is a part of the winning process. To prove that I can use a quote from Michael Jordan, the most successful NBA player.

- “I’ve missed more than 9,000 shots in my career, I’ve lost almost 300 games. Twenty-six times I’ve been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed. I’ve failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed.”

But if your losses can result in success in the future, why can't everyone succeed? What is the secret?

I found the answer by watching another athlete from another sport: Thomas Edward Brady, most known as Tom Brady, the most successful player in the NFL.
Specifically in one of his most historical wins, the Superbowl LI.

Super bowl Game
The Super Bowl is the final game in the NFL, in the NFL it has 2 divisions. This game reunites the best teams of these divisions to decide the champion.
The teams of the year 2017 were Patriots the winner of AFC division against Falcons the winner of NFC division.

The Patriots were led by Brady as the quarterback and Bill Bellichick as the coach, they already had won 4 titles together at that time.

The Falcons was a surprise team, they never won a title, however they Quarterback Matt Ryan was elected as the best player of the league, and the head coach Dan Quinn had already beaten the Patriots in a past Super Bowl when he was an assistant coach in the Seattle Seahawks team.

Start of the game
The game started tough for Brady's team, the attack unit wasn't capable of making many plays to score, on the other side the Falcons attack was able to score 2 times. 

Losing the game forced the Patriots to take more risks with his plays to try to lower the score difference, that lead Brady to do mistake:

This was a wrong decision by Brady, he tried to make a pass to a player covered by 2 defenders, one of the defenders was already prepared to defend making him anticipate the pass and intercept the ball.

Brady tried to stop him advancing with the ball to prevent the score, but he failed again. The Falcons defense scored and increased the score difference to 21 points(3 scores).

At the half time the score game was 21 x 3. I remember being in a bar watching the game and hearing from other people comments about his mistake, how bad he was playing, they even said his was a fraud.

When the game returned Falcons managed to increase the lead to 28 x 3, after this score in the NFL transmission they told any of the past teams to overcome an difference equal or higher than that.

The end of the game
I wouldn't be writing an article about overcoming mistakes to lead into victory if Brady didn't win that game, he won and became Quarterback (his position) with most NFL titles, surpassing his former child idol Joe Montana. 
People on the bar changed his opinion about Brady, the media was saying how incredible Brady was in the comeback and he was elected the best player on the field.

Focus only how to get better
Going back to my house I started to think, how Brady could overcome after so many mistakes in the start of the game? 
Because watching from the bar I could hear some comments about him, I imagine in the stadium it had the same comments or worse, creating a negative atmosphere towards Brady.
But Brady said in this motivation video(video url) he doesn't care about what the fans think of him. I think it's because we cannot control people's opinion of us, but if we do our best we can change people's opinion.
So he focused only in how to get better to the next possessions, because in the NFL each possession is a cycle, when Brady had the interception resulted into this cycle being a bad one, however he still have more cycle to do and the only way to win the game was with the next cycles, so after the bad cycle he just accepted the situation he was, learned from the play and made sure his teammates would be motivated to the next possessions to help him to win the game.

That's why Brady turned the winnest player of all time at the end of his career. It was painful to him lose too, but he never let the loss and the impact define himself, he always learned from it and focus how to get better for the next play.

My experience
I experienced something similar in the biggest mistake in my career. It was painful to get through that situation, but I focused on how to improve with that and be better at the next challenges. At the end of my cycle in that company I finished with a good feedback from my leader and teammates with all the other good things I did.

The reason for that can be explain by a phrase Michael Lombard an former NFL GM including the Patriots Brady's team, sad in in his podcast after his son got fired by a NFL team:
    -  Nobody will care about you got fired, nobody cares. What matters from this point forward is how do you do an autopsy on what happened, how do you understand what went down and make notes and you learn.
If you learn from the mistake, for the next challenge you'll be more prepared because at least the last mistake you will not let happen again, so you have more chances to win. So if you win people will remember you as a winner, like Jordan and Brady.

To end up this article I would like to share an phrase once told to me:
- Making mistakes is human, living with the mistake is not.
