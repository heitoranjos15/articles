## The secret value of an mistake

## How to win with your mistakes

## Introduction 
When you do an mistakes, what's your reaction? Mine was hardful, usually I let the mistake hit my confidence and let me thinking I was capable enough, the whole process and all the things I did was a failure because of one mistake.

Watching sports competition and seing the most sucessful athletes carrer made me change this thinking, specially about what means failure. My biggest mistake was letting my mistakes define who I was and call myself as a failure. However I looked at some athletes sucessful and they did mistakes in big moments too, but they still are reconized as sucessful persons. 
Michael Jordan as example has this quote:

- “I’ve missed more than 9,000 shots in my career, I’ve lost almost 300 games. Twenty-six times I’ve been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed. I’ve failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed.”

So the one of the most sucessful baskeball athletes had to make a lot of mistakes to be sucessful, this was totally the reverse I was thinking. 
However what about the others players? I'm sure more players had more shots and games missed than him, why they didn't succeed? What makes the mistakes by Jordan being different by the others? What is the secret?

I found the answer by watching another athlete from another sport: Thomas Edward Brady, most known as Tom Brady, the most successful player in the NFL.
Specifically in one of his most historical wins, the Superbowl LI.

## Super bowl Game
The Super Bowl is the final game in the NFL, in the NFL it has 2 divisions. This game reunites the best teams of these divisions to decide the champion.
The teams of the year 2017 were Patriots the winner of AFC division against Falcons the winner of NFC division.

The Patriots were led by Brady as the quarterback and Bill Bellichick as the coach, they already had won 4 titles together at that time.

The Falcons was a surprise team, they never won a title, however they Quarterback Matt Ryan was elected as the best player of the league, and the head coach Dan Quinn had already beaten the Patriots in a past Super Bowl when he was an assistant coach in the Seattle Seahawks team.

## Start of the game
The game started tough for Brady's team, the attack unit wasn't capable of making many plays to score, on the other side the Falcons attack was able to score 2 times. 

Losing early in the game forced the Patriots to take more risks with his plays to try to lower the score difference, that lead Brady to do mistake:

This was a wrong decision by Brady, he tried to make a pass to a player covered by 2 defenders, one of the defenders was already prepared to defend making him anticipate the pass and intercept the ball.

Brady tried to stop him advancing with the ball to prevent the score, but he failed again. The Falcons defense scored and increased the score difference to 21 points(3 scores).

The game in the begging of the 3 period of 4 was 28 x 3, after the score from Atlanta the broadcast was informing no other past team had overcome an 25 points deficit in the superbowl after. I was in a bar watching the game and still remember peoples saying bad comments about Brady and he already had lost the game, but I was looking at Brady and he never appeared that his confidence was lost.

He was trying to keep his teammates with confidence and remembering the game still happening.

Thinking about this situation, in the past I would act different than Brady, I would probably be scared of what of other people are thinking about my mistakes and to quit from the game to not make more mistakes, that would made me lose the game.

Well Brady did the reverse and that's why I'm writing this article. He choose to leaded his team to overcome the biggest score deficit in an Superbowl, after the game Brady was selected as the best player in the field even after the mistake, with this title he surpassed his former child idol Joe Montana and was the only Quarterback with 5 title in his name.

## The end of the game

Brady once said he didnt care about public opinions, the only thing he cared is his opinion and his teammates, that's why even after his mistakes he was the guy talking to his teammates to still focus in the game because isn't over yet, he answer after his mistake was to not led that define him being a looser.

At the end he was selected as the best player of the game, people in the broadcast was talking how incredible he was in the comeback, after his mistake each possession he had he leaded his team to score.


## Overcoming every situation
- Making mistakes is human, living with the mistake is not. 

Going back to my house I wondered, how Brady managed to overcome everything was going through. It was an difficult situation, but he always never looked as a looser in that game.

But if you figure out how american football is it's try to simulate a real life experience into an game, let me explain how:

American football is a game based in cycles, each cycle the opposse teams have different roles one as the attack and the other as defense, after a score or you are out of changes to advance the field the attack team loose the possesion of the ball to the opose team.

So when Brady made the mistake of the interception, he made his team lose one possesion and let the other team to score. That happens in our lifes too, sometimes we do a mistake and that have some consequences to someone as an example an job interview.
Being in a process to get an job normally have more than 1 candidate for the job, if you do an mistake or is not at your best during the process, it probably favors another person to get the job and vice-versa, that's how the cycle works.
Now after you failed, what you do?

For Brady the answer was to go foward to the next play, he was frustaded with his play and the way the game was going in favor of Atlanta Falcons, however he really want to win the game and only being frustaded would not help to win, so he quickly reseted his mood to learn from the mistake and be prepared to the next play.

## They dont care about your mistakes
- Somebody gotta be watchin' you, but no one is. It's kinda crazy life could be this simple -- Mac Miller

Other feeling we have after the mistake is made is how the public opinion will think of us, for that I'll use Michael Lombardi words:
-  Nobody will care about you got fired, nobody cares. What matters from this point forward is how do you do an autopsy on what happened, how do you understand what went down and make notes and you learn.
Michael Lombardi is an former NFL GM, he won 2 Superbowl titles in his carrer at 49ers and Patriots (during Brady era), that quote is from his podcast GM Shuffle when he was commenting about his son who got fired by the Raiders.

Lombardi points is true, and to prove that I can bring Brady situation again. When he was losing the game I remember a lot of critcism of his mistakes, but looking at Brady he wasn't affect by the public opinion because he knows the only way to prove then wrong is to get better for the next plays only, so after the mistake he analyse his play with the coaches see what he need to improve for the next plays, then he got better during the game and was selected as the best player on the field. So at the end no one was talking about the bad plays only in how he managed to overcome everything.

What really matters for people is how you act after the mistake happens, if you still being cursed by the mistakes and act that really ruined your mood, well that will be the public opinion from yourself, however if you learn and overcome from that the opinion will be different. It's never about the mistake is about your own actions. 

## Conclusion
That's the secret and what mades Brady and Jordan mistakes different from the others, they are never scared of taking risks even if that risk will lead him to a mistake, because they know it's a part of the process and will only made them grow from it. That doesnt mean they made mistakes on purpose to learn, but they will not avoid to try with fear of a failure.

Failure means a weakness on yourself, and if you have the mentality to understand mistakes makes part of the process you probably will learn from it and have less mistakes in the future, resulting into more success, obviously being sucessful as Brady and Jordan needs more than that, being a winner in the sports requires a lot of more things, but I have sure if they don't have this mentality they would have this success.

If you watched or hear about this game you probably heard about how incredible the overcome was, but no one remembers the mistakes he had in the game earlier.

I bring the stories of Tom Brady and Jordan as a example because their are famous sports player, but even they have losses. And the people who lost some final games, had won some games to be there and that doesn't mean they react differently from Brady and Jordan with they mistakes, so no one can have a garantee of not loosing, however I can garantee with this mentality we can win with the losses and mistakes, and that's what makes a winner.

With this mentality you can win against the mistakes you did.

In case you repeat the mistakes, well probably this is saying you aren't capable of doing that, but now you have sure, you can adapt yourself to avoid being on these situations.

So I think that's what makes the interceptions, missed shots and failing in the clutch momements Brady and Jordan did different from the others, even when they fail they found a way to win in that situation, that's what feeds the winner only wins even when they fail.
