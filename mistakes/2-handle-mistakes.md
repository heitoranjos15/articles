Growing mindset, 4 tips to learn from the mistakes.

## Introduction
Everyone makes mistakes, even us working with technology aren't exception from that, normaly when that happens we usualy react with negativity feelings through all situation, making us to regret all situation we were in.

But Jo Boaler an education author in her book Mathematical Mindset, described a study that shows when students with a growth mindset make a mistake, that mistake triggers "significant brain growth", but only when they make a mistake.

So if only when we make mistakes result us to trigger our "brain growth", why we should regret that?

Maybe we regret because we associate mistake as a bad thing, but we can take one of scenes from Interstellar movie explaing about the Murphy's Law as example, in the movie an character called Murphy ask to her Dad Cooper about why her parents put her name associate with something bad (the Murphy's Law), Cooper answer was perfect for that question:

- Murphy's Law doenst mean that something bad will happen. What means is whatever can happen, will happen. And that sounded just fine to us.

It's the same for mistakes, when you do a mistake ins't necessary a bad thing, it only depends in our intepretation after it happens.

We never expect to make a mistake, so when we discovered our first reaction is to feel dissapointed and frustate with ourselfs for being in this situation, but that doenst mean we need to associate everything to the initial feeling, when the mistake happens the way we act before can change our feelings about the situation.

In this article I'll present some steps that I started to do in myself and changed my way of seing the mistakes, now I see as something to learn and grow up, the same mindset Jo Boaler described in her book.

### Dont play the blame game
Working in company usually when an mistake happens ins't fault for only 1 person, but if you have a part of that problem you should take fully accountability of that. 

Don't play the blame game means don't try to put your responsability in something else, because like I we learn earlier mistakes can triggers our brain growth however if you trick the brain to accept that isn't your fault but was from someone else then your brain will never trigger.

Trying to put the blame in something external can initate an discussion of that resulting into create other problems, and changing the focus of the team from the initial problem.

Instead tell your leader about the situation and be clear what part you are involved, this is important to let people know your point of view of the problem, it can help to find the solution and learn from that to avoid some future mistakes.

### Put yourself in a better mood
While reconizing your failures, you probaly will have some feeling like being dissapointed, or stressed, or depress, or everything together. Those feelings are normal and will help you to growth with this situation, so don't try to ignore it, have your time to process everything.

But don't be in this bad mood forever, that will not help to find the best solution for the problem.

My suggestion to change your mood is playing the Airplane rule:

This rules basically says, when something bad happens, please take care of yourself first then you can help the others.

We can translate this to the article situation:
- When a mistake happens, please put yourself in a great mood, then start to look for solution and help the others.

A great way to change it's like an friend of my said to me: Change your perspective.

This basically means change your way to look for the situation, the mistake happend and that's the reason you are feeling bad.
But the only way exit from this situation is to solve the problem, so you should change your perspective in this situation, instead of being dissapointed forever just realease everything and start to look for an solution that can help going out of that.

### Focus in how to solve
- "Giants are not those who don't fall, but those who stand up". Brazilian volleyball headcoah Bernadinho, in his book Transformando Suor em ouro
Now it's time to be a giant, after set yourself in a great mindset, it's time to stand up and help to find a solution to the problem.

First I recommend you to collect all the information you can, because in case you don't know where is the problem those informations can help you to find the options.

Collecting information can be from yourself, try remembering in how you ended up in this situation. You can get some information asking those questions to yourself:

- What I was trying to do/solve? We don't fail to fail, the reason you failed it's because you was trying to do/solve something and maybe did, but create a new problem.
- What is the impact of that mistake? Depending in the impact you need to be quicker to solve it, or at create little solutions to not fix everything but at least to lower it.
- How much time I have? If you have no much time, then you should look for some quick and easy solution, or ask for help.

Even asking those question sometimes it not possible to think about new solutions, maybe because you are so much involved of what did, making you not seeing the problem with other perspectives, so if you feel stuck don't hesitade to ask for some help, because more the more time you waste bigger the problem will be. 

The help can be from an coworker, other people can help you looking from another perspectives or share more information to you, and in some ocassions I ended up founding the problem or even the solution after I asked for some help and started to explain my problem, magically I found it!

Honestly it's not magical, the reason it's because of what I mentioned earlier, sometimes I got stuck seen only what I judge was the problem, but asking from some help forced me to explain all the situation, resulting into talking where started into where we are, that helped me to get more informations and seeing from others perspectives the problem, that put me in a better position to find the problem.

In case you still resistent to call for help, try the Duck approach, this approach only a Duck toy or any toy I have Woody for example, then you will explain about the situation, like he is your coworker so you can have the benefict of looking the problem from different perspectives.

### The growing mindset
So after everything is solve it, now it's maybe time to celebrate and make this experience worth, and that could be learn with the situation to grow. 

First looking back from the cause, how you put yourself in this situation, sometimes isn't capacity or knowdelege. 

For example one of my mistakes wasn't by my capacity, it was how I took care of myself emotionally. Back at that time I was pushing myself in to know more about technologies, so I started after the work to study for the rest of my day, that resulted in to expend all day long inside my room, so I stopped having a walk outside or just have a time to talk with my friends. 

When I made my mistake, it wasn't clear to myself why I put myself into that situation, I had full control and knowdelege of the project, so it wasn't technical issues. However one day instead of being inside my room, I went outside to hang out with my friends, this change of my routine made me reflect how stressed I was and how that streess was causing me to not have a great time study and work. That was the cause of my mistake, I wasn't take care of my mental health, it was burned out.

But it can be lack of knowdelege too, and it's alright to not know everything, but you can start to prepare yourself to have more knowdelege after you got expose by it.
Start to look for what technologies your project uses, and what you dont have knowdelege yet, don't wait until you start with this new technology to learn, antecipate that so when you start with the new technology you have less change for doing the mistake.

Secondly, remembering how you act during the problem, can help you grow for the next one, to that maybe you can question yourself like:
- How much time I was in bad mood after I discovered my failure?
- Did I calm down?
- Did I find the solution?
- How much I was prepared to find the solution?
- What I need to practice/learn to find the solution quicker and better?
- What I learned with all situation?

Those can help you to reflect about the whole situation and find what you need to be better.

### The mistake will never define yourself
- You make your mistakes, your mistakes never make you. Mac Miller - Goodspeed

In the moment going trough the situation, specially when I'm sad I started punish myself thinking that mistake proves me I wasn't capable, somehow going with all this negativity in myself I was able to solve it, or at least helped to find the solution. But with all this negativity I put, to protect myself from this feelings I forget everything.

My biggest mistake wasn't in the mistake, it was how I react to that. When I started to look at the mistakes as something that happend and was a failure by myself that exposes some vunerability in me, but not defines me. We need to remove this negativity about making mistakes and this article is what I did to remove from myself, now I don't regret it. Instead now I can look back to my mistakes and see as something I can learn from it, and this is what I believe is the growth mindset.
